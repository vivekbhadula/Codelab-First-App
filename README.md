# Flutter First App Codelab

Created first flutter app using codelab a few days ago.
The app is used to generate name from a startup using WordPair and is an infinite list.
We can like our favourite names and put them in a new route where all liked names will show up.
Didn't clone the repo in the beginning and ended up with two branches that can't be compared.
